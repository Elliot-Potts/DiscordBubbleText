## DiscordBubbleText

A program which takes text and coverts it into Discord's letter symbols. Pretty sure something like this has already been achieved, but I thought it would be an interesting project to try and achieve in Python. <br> <br>
This program will take user text and convert it to Discord's symbols. Makes <b>Bubble Text</b> :).
