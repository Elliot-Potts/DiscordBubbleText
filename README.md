## DiscordBubbleText

A program which takes text and coverts it into Discord's letter symbols. Pretty sure something like this has already been achieved, but I thought it would be an interesting project to try and achieve in Python. <br> <br>
This program will take user text and convert it to Discord's symbols. Makes <b>Bubble Text</b> :).<br><br>

The program works by using what's ever on your clipboard. Make sure to copy the text, press the configurable hotkey (see below), and then paste and it will have converted into bubble text. <br><br>
The hotkey is located in C:\Potts' Software\DiscordBubbles\settings.ini - the default value is CTRL+S+R, but you can change this.
